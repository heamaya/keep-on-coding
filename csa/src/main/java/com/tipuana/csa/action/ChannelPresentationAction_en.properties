channelDefinition=<em><strong>Channels</strong></em> are structures designed in an inner zone of a farm to let precipitation runoff flow after its speed has been reduced by terraces. Its width varies between 5 and 20 meters with a maximum deepness in its center of about 40 centimeters. Mostly, they have a parabolic shape, and grass is planted along of it. The difference between a natural channel and a designed channel, is that the location of a designed channel may be different from that of a natural channel. 
channelDetails=Depending on the natural <em><strong>slope</em></strong> of the <em><strong>terrain</em></strong>, to the type of <em><strong>soil</em></strong>, and to the engineer criterion of the professionals, it can be decided to build <em><strong>terraces</em></strong> with <em><strong>channels</em></strong> in strategic places, or to close all the <em><strong>terraces</em></strong> and not to build <em><strong>channels</em></strong>. Sometimes it can be decided to opt between closing the <em><strong>terraces</em></strong> or not. There are situations where the <em><strong>slopes</em></strong> are very high and it is inevitable to design <em><strong>channels</em></strong> that are not located in the same places where the natural depressions are. The difference between a designed <em><strong>channel</em></strong> and a natural one, is that in a <em><strong>designed channel</em></strong> the water flows more slowly than in a natural one.
