dikeDefinition=Structure built on natural terrain (over an inner zone of a farm, over a road in a country, or over a public road) that has between one and four <a id="outletLink" href="#"><em>outlets</em></a> and between one or two <a id="spillwayLink" href="#"><em>emergency spillways</em></a> which purpose is to retain the runoff produced by rainfall in the basin that ends in the small dam, throughout its storage area, while the outlets evacuate the generated water volume in a controlled manner, diminishing the peak of the runoff. Whenever the storage capacity of the structure is surpassed, the emergency spillways evacuate the remaining water. The dikes protect the down under water zones, mostly, the closest roads and cities from flooding, at the same time, they avoid the formation of gullies.
dikeDetails=It is built over a depression, in its extremes, the altitude over sea level must be the same. Its length varies between 150 and 1000 meters, and its maximum height varies between 1 and 4 meters. Both, its length an its height depend on the topography of the terrain where it is built. Its base width varies between 3 and 12 meters, generally the structure has a base width of 8, 10 or 12 meters when it is built over a public road, if by the contrary it is built over a zone inside a farm its base width is around three meters; and if it is built over an internal farm road, its base width varies between 5 and 10 meters. Along its length, its height varies from nothing to its maximum. The higher the dike, the more slope width is added to the end of the base width. Slope width has a value of 3 meters for each meter of height, although it can be 2.5 or 2 meters of slope width for every meter of height. Previous to building the structure, a hydrological and agronomic study is required. The outlets are located in the lowest part of the dike, perpendicular to the structure. Concrete is used as a base for the outlets and for the runoff entrance and exit structures including the box to dissipate the energy where the water falls. The runoff entrance structure consists of a cube with wings that maintains the outlet. The runoff exit structure is similar to the runoff entrance structure. The difference is that a box is added to take away energy from the falling water. The ground required to build the structure is around 2000 m³ and 10000 m³ depending on the maximum height and length of the dike, this ground has to be wet to be easily compacted. The emergency spillways are built in the extremes of the structure, it is common to build an emergency spillway in one extreme of the structure. The maintenance of a dike involves adding or removing ground from it. Sometimes it may be necessary to fix the runoff entrance or exit structures. In general the dikes have between 1 and 4 outlets with a diameter of: 0.5, 0.8, 1 meters. The spillway generally has a length of 10 meters and a deepness of 0,3 meters. The storage area depends on the topography of the terrain, in general it varies from 2 up to 10 hectares.
outletDetails=It is a hollow, corrugated, metal cylinder. Its purpose is to discharge water slowly, with a flow given by its diameter of 0.5, 0.8 or 1 meters and its length. It is located in the lowest point of the terrain and in the highest point of the dike structure.
spillwayDetails=It is an auxiliary discharge zone that is built in the dike's extremes. Its purpose is to discharge water when the dike storage capacity has been exceeded by an exceptional rainfall.
