gulliesRecoveryDefinition=The worse consequence of water erosion is the formation of <em><strong>Gullies</strong></em>. In general, depending on the natural terrain's slope, the fallen rainfall and the water runoff generated can create gullies in different zones of a farm. There are situations that provided the design and construction of a system of <em><strong>terraces</strong></em>, <em><strong>dikes or small dams</strong></em> and <em><strong>channels</strong></em>, <em><strong>gullies</strong></em> can be recovered. In other cases it is a good idea to prevent the formation of gullies, building a structure that diminishes the energy of the falling water.
gulliesRecoveryDetails=It is applied on a systematized farm, without an adequate system of <em><strong>terraces</strong></em>, <em><strong>dikes</strong></em>, and <em><strong>channels</strong></em> a <em><strong>gully</strong></em> will be formed again. So the first step is to systematize a farm, then it is possible to recover its <em><strong>gullies</strong></em>. Through the passing years with our direction many gullies of different sizes have been recovered. Of course, there are some gullies that are very big, and it is not viable to recover them. In cases where structures are built, to prevent gullies from growing, the idea is to use concrete to create a kind of waterfall that diminishes the energy of the water, there are different types of these so called waterfalls, we like to call them duckbill structure.
