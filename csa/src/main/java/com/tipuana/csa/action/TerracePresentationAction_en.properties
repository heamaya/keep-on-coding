terraceDefinition=Structure built perpendicular to the natural <em>slope</em> of the <em>terrain</em> with soil taken from its surroundings. Throughout its longitude it is curvilinear and follows the natural <em>topography</em> of the <em>ground</em>. It has a width of between 14 and 20 meters and its height gradually increases along the width of the structure up to about 30 centimeters in the center, and then decreases progressively to at ground level. <em>Terraces</em> are built in families of curves at a distance of between 50 and 150 meters covering almost the entire systematized area. Its purpose is to stop and retain the flow of water that drains after <em>rainfall</em> and to prevent <em>water erosion</em> and ensure that the retained water increases the <em>crop yield</em>. Besides, the system of terraces, avoids destroying surrounding roads and areas.
terraceDetails=A farm area may have one or more families of <em><strong>terraces</strong></em>. Each family is determined according to the terrain <em>topography</em>. The natural <em>slope</em> of the terrain and its type of <em>soil</em> determine the distance between them, the higher <em>the slope</em> the shorter the distance.<em><strong>Terraces</strong></em> can be built closed all along, or opened in strategic locations. Generally wherever terraces are left open channels are built, the <em><strong>channels</strong></em> are strategically designed to lead the water by optimal terrain places. There are several ways to carry out the construction of <em><strong>terraces</strong></em>, according to particular needs of the farmer. In general, each terrace family has a mother terrace marked with a high precision <em>Global Positioning System</em> (GPS) and then built. Seeds are planted following terrace's families taking mother terraces as a guide, after harvest all the terraces are built parallel to mother terraces counting the number of rows equal to the distance that had been chosen by design. It is possible to build all terraces with tractors that have <em>Global Positioning Systems</em> (GPS) or to mark them all with a GPS and construct them without having to wait for the next year. Terraces are built with plow or cultivator, both can be combined.
