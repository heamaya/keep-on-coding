whatDoWeDoTitle=What do we do?
whatDoWeDoDescription=We apply agronomic conservationist techniques and technologies, tested and used successfully along several years all over the world to preserve <em><strong>soil</em></strong> and its <em><strong>productiveness</em></strong>, diminishing and controlling <em><strong>water erosion</em></strong> generated by precipitation runoff. Every Soil and Water Conservation Project involves climatic, agronomic and hydrological studies. To carry them out we work day by day with farmers, in groups or teams legally called consortiums, offering consultancy in each particular case.
waterErosionTitle=Water Erosion
waterErosionDescription=When it rains, the rainfall is absorbed by the soil, once it has completed its maximum absortion capacity, runoff is generated. In other words, water starts to advance in the terrain, seeking its lower zones by the action of the gravitational force. The process of remotion, movement and sedimentation of soil particles by water runoff is called <em><strong>water erosion.</strong></em> Its main consequences are: soil productiveness loss, roads destruction, cities and town flooding.
